# AI-project-2024

The goal of this project is to create an automated system for monitoring negative media and assessing client risk so that financial institutions can better identify any issues related to their clients. The technology will evaluate clients and classify them according to risk categories by searching publicly accessible adverse material, including news stories, regulatory filings, social media, and court records.

The groups consist of 4 students

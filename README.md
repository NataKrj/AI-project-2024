## Client Overview

Our client is a leading global provider of credit management services. The company focuses on helping businesses recover payments, manage credit risk and ensure financial stability. By providing debt collection services, the client enables businesses to grow while helping individuals manage and overcome debt. Operating in several regions, the client has a significant presence in Belgium, where the majority of its customer base is located.

## Problem Understanding

The client faces increasing challenges in monitoring client activities and assessing risk. With the growth of global markets and complex customer networks, manual risk evaluation is no longer sufficient. Automating risk assessment through adverse media analysis is essential to improve the detection of potential client issues and mitigate financial risks.


## Proposed Solution

To address this challenge, we propose a system for tracking adverse media coverage, evaluating client risk, and verifying company status through active checks and web scraping using APIs. Additionally, the system will conduct company status verification and scoring, ensuring real-time validation. 

This approach reduces manual effort, enhances accuracy, and provides deeper insights into client activities. The solution will help protect the client's reputation, ensure regulatory compliance, and reduce exposure to financial crimes.
